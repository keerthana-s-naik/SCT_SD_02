# A small game to guess numbers.

Hello everyone. This is my my mini project, where a random number is generated by the program and the user/player have to guess it. The user can take as many attempts as they want to guess a number.

A small overview of the game :
> This is just a small fun game to check your intusion.
> The game is user interactive. It asks for your guess.
> The game also gives you a small hint saying how close are you to guess the correct number.

Thank you.
